### Usage
### Command Line 

To run the script with multiple IPs, URLs, or CIDR ranges directly from the command line:
```
python3 CVE-2024-6387-Vulnerability-Checker.py <addresses> -p <ports> -t <timeout> 
```
* addresses: IP addresses, URLs, or CIDR ranges to check (space-separated).

* -p, --ports: Comma-separated list of port numbers for SSH (default: 22).

* -t, --timeout: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 5.0).

### From a File

To run the script with addresses specified in a file:
```
python3 CVE-2024-6387-Vulnerability-Checker.py -f <filename> -p <ports> -t <timeout>
```
* filename: File containing a list of IP addresses or CIDR ranges.

### Example Usage

To check multiple IPs, URLs, or CIDR ranges directly from the command line:

```
python3 CVE-2024-6387-Vulnerability-Checker.py 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.0/24 example.com -p 22,2222 -t 5.0
```

* To check addresses from a file:
```
python3 CVE-2024-6387-Vulnerability-Checker.py -f addresses.txt -p 22,2222 -t 5.0
```

Example addresses.txt file:
```
192.168.1.1
example.com
192.168.1.0/24
```
